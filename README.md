# Tableau-Data-Analysis
As a data analyst, being able to create esthetically pleasing and user-friendly dashboards and visualizations is crucial.
I have create this cool tableau dashboard that uses this calendar widget as your main filter, a line chart, a map, histograms, and also a heat map. 
Okay, so first of all, let me go through what I have built exactly within this dashboard. 
So you can see that all of my filters are on the left here and the main filter is going to be this calendar widget right here. 
Within here, from the drop-down, I can select my month, say, for example, August 2014, and you can see that this filtered all of my visuals. 
Then within this calendar widget, I can select a specific day, 11th of August, for example. If I click on this, this will only filter the bottom four charts. 
Let me just click on the 11th again to undo my filter. 
Then underneath, I have another three filters: year, build, square foot living, and square foot lot. 
So all I have to do here is drag the slider and then the bottom four charts will be filtered based on my condition. 
So within the dashboard here you can see that we have six visuals. We have a line chart with the average house price and then we have a map next to it where I drag the average price onto the color shelf.
